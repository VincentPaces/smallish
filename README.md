ShootR
======

Multiplayer space ship game built on the SignalR framework.  This is a work in progress.  I will be updating the Issue list with features to be added as I have time.

NOTE:  Have tons to do when it comes to organizing the repository structure =)

In order to run ShootR locally you must do the following:
1. Pull down the ShootR code.
2. Use nuget to install SignalR 1.0 Alpha. (Search SignalR in nuget)
3. Have fun =]

Final comment: The ShootR code needs to be refactored greatly!  It was put together quickly and will be refactored (and expanded) in the coming months.

Feel free to stop by and say hi at http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/ShootR and http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/signalr
